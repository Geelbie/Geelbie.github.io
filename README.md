# 3. I Love Playing Guitar

I started discovering my musical talent through playing the guitar. It helps me get rid of boredom and it also gives me another option of a past-time instead of using gadgets like almost all does these days. Overall , it is a good way to discover my talent.

# 5. Isn't Watching so Relaxing?

Last on my free-time list is watching movies or series. Like books , it takes me into another world by immersing into it. It takes me to a world that sometimes I won't experience in my life; but through watching it I experience the feeling somehow.
